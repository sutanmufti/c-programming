# Sutan's C tutorial

My journey in understanding C programming language. The project consists of folder of me practicing how things get done.

The purpose is understanding standard libraries. Simple tasks of reading and writing files. Nothing fancy, just getting the basics.

compile it in root, nothing fancy, just use ```cc``` like this: ```cc project/printf/prijtf.c``` and execute the result using ```./a.out``` because the default out executable is ```a.out```.
